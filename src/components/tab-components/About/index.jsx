            <p>
                I am Vishal Bharat Pandey. I have done my 10th and 12th from St. Xavier's High School
                in my home town Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. I completed my B. Tech in Information Technology
                with first class from Cochin University of Science And Technology, Kerala. I was placed in 
                multiple companies in my final year. Also I was GATE qualified. I chose to join in Infosys.
                I was trained in Infosys for 3 months in full stack development program with .NET core and Angular. Then I was mapped 
                into an Angular project but project was at its final stage so it ended up in two months. Then I was 
                mapped into a React JS project. I learnt React JS very quickly on my own and developed a 
                prototype of my current project with client within 15 days with one more ReactJS developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I started with my current project. This project was about developing a web page that would 
                help our client in analysing the results of the chemical experiments performed by them. We have Python 
                in our backend for data analysis. And in front end we have ReactJS for UI. I am currently working in this 
                project only because it is still in development. We are two people handling the whole front end part. 
                In the beginning of the project, there was not even a technology lead for front end. Only two developers 
                developed the project from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have passion for web development and I will continue to learn and implement my skills.
